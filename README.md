## **About Me - Dapper Bonez**

### Why I'm Here ðŸ˜„
  I am in my late 30's and have just started a Bachelor's Program at CTU Online in Information Technologies. I plan to use Git(Hub) to hold my programming and database works.

### Self Taught Skills:
  I have, over the years taught myself Linux and Windows OS repair and configurations. I'm confident in my Google search skills to fix Macs as well ðŸ˜„.
  I know the basics in a few programming languages including Java, Javascript, Python, and am currently improving my shell(scripting) abilities. I also would need a refresher but know HTML and CSS.

### Contact
  I am best reached through Discord as far as social media of any kind is concerned - same username - DapperBonez
  I love teaching others and being given problems to solve by learning the solutions with computers myself

### Random Facts
  Oldest of 5 children in 6 years and the only one to go into computers.
  I can perform in roughly 13 different styles of hip hop dance or street styles.
  I am a bit autistic but high-functioning so I tend to be very analytical and a bit less emotional than others think when they talk to me. Just a heads up ðŸ˜„
  Have used Linux, mostly Ubuntu, as my daily driver for over 10 years - Also have done LFS once and arch linux install a few times with manual grub install.
  - Fav Music is almost any Techno or Electric Swing. Check out Jamie Berry and Dark Cat.
  - I watch a lot of anime, have seen something close to over 600+ different ones.
